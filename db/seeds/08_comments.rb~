Other courses are correlated to training gaps or courses that build on skills learned from previous training sessions. What stands out in Athens is that the Hellenic Police does not just send the same people to every training, nor do the courses seem to be doled out as an internal favor or reward.

The questions and responses are as follows. 1) What security forces have the 30 officers trained to date come from? Have any been from the ATPU? Previous courses have involved Kenyan and Ugandan police from various services including the Kenyan ATPU. Officers are selected on the basis of their individual abilities to function effectively in the undercover context. 2) What forces/units will be trained during this course? This course, too, will involve Kenyan, Ugandan and possibly Tanzanian police officers including the likely participation of Kenyan ATPU officers. Individual participants have not yet been selected. 3) How many will be trained? The class will be small, 12-15 at most, with the exact number determined by the quality of the candidates. 4) How has the State Department determined that this program has been successful? This course has been of direct benefit to investigations in the region and in the United States.

Before the curriculum is prepared for production, the Surabaya office could carefully review the curriculum to ensure that the content does not violate the Establishment Clause. •	Production enforcement: Surabaya could also monitor the project once it begins production and if there are any problems on the air. If a situation should arise where the Establishment Clause is violated, Surabaya and the Jakarta-based GOR could carry out the following: 1) First violation will result in a verbal warning and meeting; 2) A second violation will result in a written warning and meeting; and 3) A third violation will result in suspension of the next tranche and Surabaya and Jakarta can decide if negotiation is possible with NU or suspension of the project is necessary. Of course, all these steps will be done in close coordination with the Grants Officer. •	TV-9 production manager: The Surabaya consulate believes some of the supervision can also be done through close coordination with the TV-9 production manager, Hakim Jayli, who is an IVLP graduate and used to working with donors. The Surabaya office has moderate confidence that he will grasp the importance of upholding the Establishment Clause to guarantee funding.

Fusion cell development is an effective way to enhance information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence services, and it has potential CT operational value. While this project is focused on improving MOI internal coordination, the threat information is regional in impact: arms smuggling, terrorist groups operating in border areas, foreign terrorist fighters moving across North Africa. If the fusion center brings on board liaison officers from the Tunisian Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Defense, that would prepare it for the next step, interagency cooperation, and specifically coordination with MOJ CT initiatives. A GOT approval early on for the liaison officers would be beneficial. The regional threats require international cooperation, which could be developed through bilateral, trilateral or multi-country arrangements between the fusion cell and similar institutions in neighboring countries. Through the FBI’s advisory role, the project may allow the USG to influence the standards of the fusion cell. The IAA would be with FBI and the disbursement mechanism would be Washington-based. The visit to the United States to see a fusion center model in operation will be useful. The equipment outlay represents half the budget and goes to equipment, plus training, and furnishings.

RSI engagement, we expect, will disclose additional information on this: Maldives has seen a significant rise in drug trafficking, drug abuse and religious radicalization within its borders. DEA has been coordinating with Maldives Police Service (MPS) officers to better understand and assess this. DEA received sensitive information from MPS Intelligence officers regarding organized criminal groups operating in Maldives. MPS stated that these groups attract and recruit “at risk” Maldivian youths into their ranks. These organizations are involved in drug trafficking and other violent criminal activity and members of these groups also harbor religious extremist ideologies. Reports of radicalized youths traveling to join jihadist forces in Syria began emerging in October 2013 when two individuals were detained at the International airport in Malé. According to media sources, there are approximately 20 Maldivians presently fighting in the Syrian civil war. Considering its relatively small size (estimated population of 340,000), Maldives has proven to be a fertile ground for Jihadist recruitment, particularly among the younger generation. Additional sensitive DEA source information DEA indicates that a heroin trafficking organization with operational ties to Dubai, Pakistan, and India attempted to send a consignment of Afghan sourced heroin from Pakistan to Maldives circa July 2014. Elements of this organization are known to have ties to Indian and Pakistani extremist groups operating in or near Kashmir. A leading member of this trafficking organization was involved in money laundering operations (through a Hawala) for Kashmiri separatist groups with ties to Pakistan based terror groups such as Lashkar E Taiba (LeT) and Al Barq.

Good FTF angle - the participants from last June expressed the interests of their individual agencies to target extremists traveling to Syria. - Legat Rabat requests that Libyans be included in this proposal. Rabat recognizes that given the current dynamics in the region and with visas, this may not be possible, but they would like to leave the option open and work towards maintaining their participation. If their participation is not possible, Rabat will divide up their slots to the other 3 remaining countries participating in the course. Moroccan MFA has told Post that Libyan visa applicants may apply at the Moroccan embassy in Tunis. - Libyan participation is contingent on approval by the technical assistance working group and the Libya desk, given the changing nature of Libyan politics and affiliations. Participants must be vetted, if applicable. - FBI’s Africa Fusion Cell will draft a plan that outlines how student performance will be monitored for the advanced course. - Students will be requested to bring the laptops issued to them during the basic course RSI-1063. However, these were provided as agency resources and not individual resources so we are unsure if the laptops will be available for their use. Additionally, we anticipate software expenses for new analytic programs students will use. As such, the FBI wants to maintain the projected laptop budget.', user_id: u.id, comment_date: '2014-10-25 13:22:15.773')

Based on feedback from RSO Colombo and Maldivian government officials, I believe the ILA format, while expensive, is an optimal mode for engaging in Maldives at this time.

Whether or not this happens, Maldives is struggling to find solutions to a very serious recruitment problem (ISIL and other groups), one that is of sufficient magnitude to impact U.S. interests. An ILA can, and I expect will, play a significant role in influencing Maldivian officials to apply new legal authorities using methods calculated to comply with GCTF best practices and other strategies for long-term success in countering terrorism. In visiting Maldives, it was clear that the previous ILA transformed strong GOM support into tangible progress on the ground. Given the scope of the threat, steps being undertaken by Maldives to address it, lack of capacity and potential for (e.g, human rights) misteps by Maldivian authorities, and willingness of Maldivian authorities to work in partnership -- I believe this proposal is both timely and a strong candidate for funding.

On the other hand, King’s College seems to have a good internal risk assessment policy for foreign field work (attached). •	ICSR said that FTFs actually want their narrative to be relayed to USG and Western governments and this is why he may get access. That means the USG is funding FTF “advertising” of the FTF group or activity. •	UCSR believes the PhD candidate would appreciate integrating his RSI proposal field work findings and interviews into his own research. State should indicate clearly to ICSR if the project’s findings can or can’t be integrated into the student’s PhD dissertation/research. I recommend that UCSR separate the two research efforts. •	The Department could always buy the ICSR product off the shelf. It could be that the independence and quality of the ICSR analysis is enhanced if it was independently funded. ', user_id: u.id, comment_date: '2014-11-12 22:40:45.937')

Because of sensitivities and security concerns, it would be impossible for any Westerner to observe these high profile cases in the courtroom firsthand. Information from the reports that the court observer has provided has been read eagerly and with great interest by counterterrorism, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies in Washington. In addition to the factual reporting, the court observer\'s reports have provided first-hand knowledge about Indonesia\'s trial procedures and insights into Indonesia\'s prosecution-to-sentencing process that we would otherwise not know. The reports have also pointed out certain problem areas, such as courtroom security, where the Indonesian judicial system could benefit from capacity-building assistance and which we are addressing – again these problem areas would not have been known to us (certainly not to the extent that we know now) had it not been for the court observers reports.

OPDAT/DOJ has correctly identified this problem as a major area of concern for the continued successful criminal prosecution of terrorist cases. It is not enough to adopt special security measures for high-profile cases. Basic courtroom security measures need to be developed and institutionalized, which is what this proposal intends to accomplish. I have spoken to the Project Owner and Implementer and suggested that the proposal be expanded to include the participation of Malaysian judges. Since Malaysia is repealing its Internal Security Act (ISA) and replacing it with legislation that will require criminal prosecution of terrorist suspects (rather than the detention without trial allowed by the ISA), Malaysian prosecutors and judges will face the same kinds of courtroom security threats as Indonesian prosecutors and judges. Including Malaysian judges to participate in this project will raise their awareness of the important issue of courtroom security during terrorist trials – an issue which I believe to date they have not focused on. Including Malaysian judges in the program will also provide this proposal a regional platform. We intend to revise this proposal, including an increase in the budget to approximately $58,000, to include Malaysian judicial participation. Until we make those revisions, this comment will serve as a placeholder. ', user_id: u.id, comment_date: '2012-03-15 02:13:52.603')

Malaysia will almost certainly see a need for a similar course for its judiciary, given the imminent repeal of its Internal Security Act, which will necessitate for the first time that Malaysia tries suspected terrorists in a court of law. The Philippines should also be interested in a similar training course, given its determination to move away from a military approach to counter terrorism toward a civilian rule of law approach, which will require a judiciary capable of trying high-profile terrorism cases. In Thailand, too, recent events have shown that in addition to its problems in the south, international terrorists are present in the country and are conducting illegal activities there, showing the need for Thailand’s judicial system to have the capability of conducting terrorism trials that would likely have international attention. The proposed activities will take place in coordination with the GCTF Southeast Asia Working Group, which will be able to further highlight the program to its regional members. I regard this proposal as a pilot project for what I believe will be an inevitable demand for similar projects in other countries in Southeast Asia.', user_id: u.id, comment_date: '2012-04-05 01:48:24.25')

Because previous versions of Philippines AML/CTF laws severely restricted law enforcement actions, police and prosecutors largely did not investigate or take legal actions against suspicious activities. As a result, police and prosecutors have little experience and would greatly benefit from training and guidance from a Technical Assistance Advisor on these matters. The expert could serve in a regional capacity as well, working with Resident Legal Advisors (RLAs) in the region who are conducting capacity-building activities in AML/CTF prosecutions and consulting directly with national Financial Intelligence Units and financial institutions on detecting and investigating suspicious financial activities. As noted in the proposal, RLAs in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur have expressed concerns that the Technical Assistance Advisor might duplicate efforts they are already undertaking, but I am confident – as is the RLA in Manila - that we can coordinate the work so that it is complementary rather than redundant. Relatively little AML/CTF capacity building has taken place in the region so far, and this proposal can help address the gaps. ', user_id: u.id, comment_date: '2012-09-13 22:25:44.18')

In short, it could be ok if CT has a factual basis for its justification that the provision of memorabilia generates actual benefits in the execution of its program. For example, if the argument is based upon the receipt of a benefit or information by the United States Government, CT needs to tie this benefit to the provision of the memorabilia items. If the argument is that these items help develop a positive working relationship with individuals, CT needs to set forth facts that would show that we seek to establish ongoing relationships with individuals who have participated in these training programs and these items help maintain such relationships. It would ultimately be a policy decision by the CT Coordinator to determine whether the provision of such items is a “necessary expense” of the provision of anti-terrorism assistance.

The second phase, Operational Cash Courier Training, builds on the classroom training, but it shifts the training venue from the class room into an operational environment, such as an airport, where mentors assisting students in real time in implementation of the techniques learned in phase one.

The final stage of this programs is a structured “train the trainer” course, which in addition to providing basic instruction skills, teaches its participants to give the BCS and Operational Cash Courier Training to host nation students. One of the primary objectives of this training initiative is to focus on the investigative, as well as the interdiction aspects of illicit cross border financing. It also stresses that to be successful a “whole of government” approach is needed to address illicit cross border financial operations; thus customs officials will need to work with investigators, as well as with Financial Intelligence Units and other entities. The entities to be trained reflect this approach. The training audience for this initiative includes 30-40 representatives from the Customs, Border Protection, Federal Investigative Agencies and Port Authorities from Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

All training programmes are for law enforcement and relevant criminal justice officials. Law enforcement training takes place under the framework of the relevant regional police chiefs and coordination organisations. From time to tell, our regional partners invite relevant officials from border control and specialised investigative units. But all officials come from law enforcement. Criminal justice officials include specialised CT prosecutors, financial investigators and FIU officials, etc, and this training takes place in partnership with the African Prosecutors Associations (APA). All officials trained under this project fall under the category of relevant CT law enforcement. (2)	I see mention of ECOWAS, I’m assuming this is not intended to be assistance to ECOWAS to enhance the ability of ECOWAS – rather it is assistance to the countries, for the purpose of enhancing the ability of those countries law enforcement personnel to counter terrorism.

All training programmes are for law enforcement and relevant criminal justice officials. Law enforcement training takes place under the framework of the relevant regional police chiefs and coordination organisations. From time to tell, our regional partners invite relevant officials from border control and specialised investigative units. But all officials come from law enforcement. Criminal justice officials include specialised CT prosecutors, financial investigators and FIU officials, etc, and this training takes place in partnership with the African Prosecutors Associations (APA). All officials trained under this project fall under the category of relevant CT law enforcement. (2)	I see mention of ECOWAS, I’m assuming this is not intended to be assistance to ECOWAS to enhance the ability of ECOWAS – rather it is assistance to the countries, for the purpose of enhancing the ability of those countries law enforcement personnel to counter terrorism. While we implement the activities in W Africa in partnership with the ECOWAS Commission, the recipients of the training (both regional and national trainings) are law enforcement officials from the various ECOWAS member states.', user_id: u.id, comment_date: '2013-05-15 09:02:09.747')

However, everyone that cleared on the CN should receive notice that an AM to F has been added to the CN package, and at the very minimum provided a copy upon request. Secondly, the countries being added are rich countries and therefore are subject to F\'s guidance on the presumption against giving foreign assistance to rich countries. F\'s SOP on rich countries says that if a rich country received funds from the NADR sub-account in question, in the prior fiscal year, then that equates to tacit approval and absolves that country from needing further approval. So, please provide evidence to this affect for each country, or prepare an AM to F for each country that did not receive these NADR-CTF funds in FY09.

I know the GSCF Libya project has been stalled for some time and I’m wondering if this project will face similar constraints. PM’s only comment was that they asked us to specify in the CN that “The EUBAM liaison officer will also support the vetting of training candidates for future border security assistance.” 2. Could you also provide some detail on what the EU Border Assistance Mission is currently doing in Libya? EUBAM is currently working on national border strategy development, airport security in Tripoli, and maritime border security. 3. What is the estimated split between the cost for the liaison officer and equipment? The vast majority of anticipated costs are labor related. Equipment will be supplemental to enable to liaison officer\'s outreach. No specific big ticket items are planned at this time, as part of the liaison officer\'s job will be to assess Libyan border security needs. 4. The amounts are slightly different from the original notification and the renotification—were some of the funds spent from the original project? Yes, $4,607.28 was spent from the original project. Before it was determined that we would shift the programming, DS/T/ATA conducted a coordination visit with French training partners in Paris to de-conflict PNL curricula.

Yesterday Sharla in L/LFA said CT could pay for the proposed RSI programs with NADR/CTF funds, since there was no difference between CTF and ATA authorities. 2.	At the same time these FY13 funds need to obligated soon before they expire. 3.	And, it is my understanding, that reapportioning NADR/CTF into NADR/ATA would require CT to wait for a separate and additional memo to be approved by OMB before the CN could be sent forward. So, if obligating these funds is urgent, why bother with the extra and unnecessary processing time required by an OMB reapportionment memo? Wouldn’t this needlessly drag out processing time? Why does this memo still seek to turn NADR/CTF funds into NADR/ATA funds? And, even if it doesn’t add extra time before a CN can go up, why bother with it at all if it’s not necessary? Please advise.
